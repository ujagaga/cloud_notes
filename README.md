# Cloud Notes

Simple note-taking app easy to back up via cloud.
The app itself is just a lightweight Python desktop app with a configurable folder to be used for notes. 
It is this folder that you can back up to save your notes.
All the notes are just text files which the application reads and displays in a simple resizable window.

## How to start

You will need Python3 with TkInter installed. 
Just run the script. The default notes folder is `$HOME/.cloud_notes/notes`. To change it just click on "browse" button.
